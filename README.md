# VirtualPet
WCCI week two project

Virtual Pet provides a simuation of caring for a pet. Your pet has four health properties: hunger, thirst, waste and boredom. 
You may feed, water, take out or play with your pet. These will increase some your pets health but decrease others. 
Also overdoing them may have unintended consequences. 

If any health items get too low they will highlight. If your pet dies you will be given a cause of death.

Main Program contains the basic user interface providing the menu and status reports.
class VirtualPet handles interpreting the input and updating the health status along with reporting back to Main program.
